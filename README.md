TODO: make fancy readme

How to set up your code environment?
• How to obtain the data you use?
• How to reproduce your results? e.g. the training scripts (if applicable) and the inferences scripts.
• For closed-sourced LLMs such as ChatGPT, we expect you to write code to call their API, as well as playing with different inference setups (e.g., different algorithms and/or hyperparameters) instead of using the web GUI.
• You are anticipated to write code for result analysis, generating figures and plots, etc.
